## Hi there! I'm Caye. Nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹
- I'm based in Manila, Philippines, and I've been building things on the web since 2018.
- I primarily use Javascript (React, Node, GraphQL), occasionally Python (Django) for my projects. Sometimes I write what I learn on [Medium (mcborreo)](https://mcborreo.medium.com).
- I'm not currently looking for opportunities, but feel free to be in touch at [hello@caye.codes](mailto:hello@caye.codes).
